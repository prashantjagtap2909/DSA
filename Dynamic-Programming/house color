There is a row of N houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.



 long long int distinctColoring(int N, int r[], int g[], int b[]){
   
         long long int dp[N][3];

        dp[0][0]=r[0];
        dp[0][1]=g[0];
        dp[0][2]=b[0];

        for(int i=1;i<N;i++){

                dp[i][0]=r[i]+min({dp[i-1][1],dp[i-1][2]});

                dp[i][1]=g[i]+min({dp[i-1][0],dp[i-1][2]});

                dp[i][2]=b[i]+min({dp[i-1][0],dp[i-1][1]});

        }

        return min({dp[N-1][0],dp[N-1][1],dp[N-1][2]});
    }
