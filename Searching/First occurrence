To find first occurrence of element

int firstOccurrence(int arr[],int n,int x){
    int low = 0,high = n-1;
    while(low<=high){
        int mid = (low+high)/2;
        
        if(x>arr[mid]
            low = mid+1;
        else if(x<arr[mid]
            high = mid-1
        else{
            if(mid==0 || arr[mid-1]!=arr[mid])
            else
                high = mid-1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
